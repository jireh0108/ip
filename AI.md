ChatGPT was used for branch-A-CodeQuality to check the quality of code.

ChatGPT has been useful in debugging small errors, but fails in following
the given Java checkstyle unless specified. Additionally, ChatGPT is poor at 
maintaining  SLAP in code and often introduces different levels of abstraction 
in the same code chunk.

ChatGPT may lead to overall time loss with poor code quality - unless used smartly 
with prompts that explain the context.
